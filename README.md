# gamedb
A simple 'owned game' database. See your games and where they are.

I will not upload my personal game information. Only the test .csv files are
added (they contain only example games)

Instructions about gamedb components and how to use them will be provided
in a future.

Requirements:
    * Python 3.5+
    * PySide (it will be PySide2 soon) [+Qt4]
    * sqlite3
